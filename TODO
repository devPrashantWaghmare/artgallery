### Workflow Strategy for Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with Optimized Performance and Security

#### **High-Level Goals**
1. **Minimize database queries**: Utilize caching (Redis) to reduce direct MongoDB queries.
2. **Ensure security**: Safeguard sensitive data, particularly roles and permissions.
3. **Maintain performance**: Ensure scalability to handle high concurrent user traffic efficiently.

---

### **Stepwise Workflow**

---

#### **Step 1: JWT Role Integration**
- **Objective**: Store user roles securely in JWT for efficient session handling.
- **Process**:
  - On login:
    1. Authenticate the user.
    2. Query the database for the user's role and version (`userVersion` or `roleVersion`).
    3. Embed the role and version in the JWT payload.
  - Use HTTP-only, secure cookies for storing the JWT token to minimize XSS risks.

---

#### **Step 2: Implement Redis Caching**
- **Objective**: Reduce MongoDB load and enhance performance.
- **Process**:
  - On user login:
    1. Check Redis for the user's role and version.
    2. If found:
        - Use the cached data.
    3. If not found:
        - Query MongoDB for the role and version.
        - Cache the result in Redis with a TTL (e.g., 1 hour).
- **Redis Management**:
  - Ensure Redis is configured with sufficient memory and eviction policies to handle high traffic.

---

#### **Step 3: Handle Role Updates Dynamically**
- **Objective**: Ensure role updates are reflected promptly without requiring extensive re-queries.
- **Process**:
  - Maintain a `userVersion` or `roleVersion` field in MongoDB for each user.
  - When roles are updated:
    1. Increment the version in MongoDB.
    2. Invalidate Redis cache for the user.
    3. Prompt re-login or force session refresh for the user to obtain the updated role.

---

#### **Step 4: Middleware for RBAC Enforcement**
- **Objective**: Decentralize role validation using middleware.
- **Process**:
  - Decode JWT from the user session.
  - Verify the role and version:
    1. Compare JWT `role` with the required role for the requested route.
    2. Check the `userVersion` from JWT against the cached version in Redis.
  - If mismatched:
    - Query MongoDB for the latest role and version.
    - Update the session or deny access.

---

#### **Step 5: Scheduled Role Synchronization**
- **Objective**: Ensure consistency between Redis and MongoDB.
- **Process**:
  - Periodically run a background task to:
    1. Fetch all active users from MongoDB.
    2. Sync role data in Redis for users whose TTLs have expired or are about to expire.
- **Tools**:
  - Use a task scheduler (e.g., `node-cron`, `bull`) for efficient syncing.

---

#### **Step 6: Secure JWT Storage and Rotation**
- **Objective**: Prevent token theft and ensure long-term security.
- **Process**:
  - Use secure, HTTP-only cookies for storing JWTs.
  - Rotate tokens periodically:
    1. Issue new tokens at regular intervals.
    2. Revalidate roles and versions during token rotation.

---

#### **Step 7: Fine-Grained Access Control**
- **Objective**: Implement permission-based access for detailed control.
- **Process**:
  - Extend roles with granular permissions (e.g., `CREATE_PAINTING`, `VIEW_USERS`).
  - Store permissions in MongoDB or Redis.
  - Embed critical permissions in JWT payloads when necessary for quick access.
  - Validate permissions in middleware before granting access to sensitive resources.

---

#### **Step 8: Audit Logging**
- **Objective**: Monitor role changes and critical actions for debugging and compliance.
- **Process**:
  - Maintain a dedicated MongoDB collection for logging:
    1. Log changes to roles or permissions.
    2. Record details like action type, user ID, timestamp, and performed-by (e.g., `superadmin`).
  - Use logs for analysis and security audits.

---

### **Key Flow Diagrams**

1. **Login Workflow**:
   - **Trigger**: User logs in.
   - **Actions**:
     1. Authenticate user credentials.
     2. Check Redis for role/version:
        - If present → Use cached data.
        - If absent → Query MongoDB → Cache in Redis → Generate JWT.
     3. Send JWT to the user in a secure cookie.

2. **Request Workflow**:
   - **Trigger**: User makes a request to a protected route.
   - **Actions**:
     1. Decode JWT in middleware.
     2. Verify role and version:
        - Match → Grant access.
        - Mismatch → Query database or deny access.

3. **Role Update Workflow**:
   - **Trigger**: Admin changes a user's role.
   - **Actions**:
     1. Increment the `roleVersion` in MongoDB.
     2. Invalidate Redis cache for the affected user.
     3. Prompt session refresh or re-login.

### **Benefits of Workflow**
- **Performance**: Caching reduces MongoDB queries, improving scalability.
- **Security**: Secure JWT handling and version control ensure robust protection.
- **Consistency**: Scheduled synchronization maintains data integrity across systems.
