When it comes to implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and managing permissions in e-commerce websites, many platforms follow practices aimed at reducing redundancy, simplifying updates, and maintaining flexibility. Here's how other e-commerce platforms typically handle RBAC and permissions:

1. Separation of Role Permissions and User-Specific Permissions
Approach:

They define roles with predefined permissions in a roles collection/table.
Users inherit permissions directly from their assigned role, avoiding duplication.
For exceptions, user-specific permissions are stored separately and override or extend the role-based permissions dynamically.
Example:

A user might be assigned the "subadmin" role, but with a specific override like canOfferDiscounts: false.
Implementation in Schema:

json
Copy code
{
  "role": "subadmin",
  "customPermissions": {
    "canOfferDiscounts": false
  }
}
2. Permission Grouping
Permissions are grouped by functionality to simplify management.

Instead of granular flags (canManageProducts, canManageOrders), permissions are categorized into groups like productManagement, orderManagement, etc.

Each group can include specific actions, reducing repetitive key definitions.

Example:

json
Copy code
{
  "role": "admin",
  "permissions": {
    "productManagement": ["create", "update", "delete"],
    "orderManagement": ["view", "refund"],
    "userManagement": ["suspend", "update"]
  }
}
3. Role Hierarchies
Permissions are inherited hierarchically to avoid duplication.

For example:

Admin includes all permissions.
Subadmin includes permissions specific to their scope, such as order and user management but not system-level controls.
Example:

json
Copy code
{
  "role": "subadmin",
  "inherits": "user",
  "permissions": {
    "canManageOrders": true,
    "canOfferDiscounts": true
  }
}
4. Fine-Grained Permission Control Using Dynamic Rules
Platforms allow dynamic rules for permissions, such as which resources or products a user can access.

These rules often involve logic like:

"Subadmins can only access users they manage."
"Artists can edit only their own listings."
Example:

json
Copy code
{
  "role": "subadmin",
  "permissions": {
    "canManageOrders": { "scope": "assigned" },
    "canViewReports": { "scope": "team" }
  }
}
5. Storing Permissions in an External Service
Large platforms use services like AWS IAM, Okta, or a custom permissions service.
Benefits:
Centralized permission management across multiple apps or services.
Real-time updates without schema-level modifications.
Example: Shopify uses services to manage store owners, staff, and third-party app permissions.
6. Optimized Permissions Caching
To avoid redundant queries:

Permissions are computed once and cached with the user session/token.
This is common in platforms like Amazon or Flipkart, where session tokens include encoded permissions.
Reduces database hits for every request.

Example:

JWT contains:
json
Copy code
{
  "role": "admin",
  "permissions": ["createProduct", "updateProduct", "manageUsers"]
}
How Your Current Design Compares
Your current design has a good foundation, but it suffers from redundancy and complexity due to the following:

Repetition of permissions in multiple schemas (users, roles, role_permissions).
Lack of grouping or inheritance leads to difficulty managing large permission sets.
Overly granular permissions without dynamic rules for specific cases.
Recommendations to Improve Your Design
Refactor to Avoid Repetition:

Store permissions centrally in roles.
Add a customPermissions field for user-specific overrides.
Use Grouped or Categorized Permissions:

Instead of individual flags, use categorized permissions like orderManagement, userManagement.
Implement Inheritance or Dynamic Rules:

Allow roles to inherit permissions from other roles to simplify updates.
Introduce Permission Evaluation at Runtime:

Use middleware or utility functions to evaluate user permissions dynamically at runtime.
Cache Permissions with Tokens:

Consider encoding permissions in JWT or storing them in session storage for faster access.


The data shows the roles (`admin`, `subadmin`, etc.) and the permissions assigned to each role. Below is a table outlining the permissions for `admin` and `subadmin` roles.

| **Permission**          | **Admin** | **Subadmin (Overall)** | **Subadmin1** | **Subadmin2** |
|--------------------------|-----------|-------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Can Onboard Artists      | Yes       | Yes                     | Yes           | No            |
| Can Offer Discounts      | Yes       | Yes                     | Yes           | No            |
| Can Manage Products      | Yes       | No                      | No            | No            |
| Can Verify Users         | Yes       | No                      | No            | No            |
| Can Manage Orders        | Yes       | No                      | Yes           | Yes           |
| Can Manage Transactions  | Yes       | No                      | No            | No            |
| Can Manage Payments      | Yes       | No                      | No            | No            |
| Can View Reports         | No        | No                      | No            | Yes           |
|--------------------------|-----------|-------------------------|---------------|---------------|

### Explanation:
1. **Admin** has all permissions (`true` for every permission).
2. **Subadmin** has limited permissions:
   - **Subadmin1**:
     - Can onboard artists.
     - Can offer discounts.
     - Can manage orders.
   - **Subadmin2**:
     - Can manage orders.
     - Can view reports.

This detailed breakdown allows for a clear understanding of role-based access control. Let me know if you want further clarification!
To design a comprehensive workflow for the subadmin's role in managing and approving artwork while aligning with modern e 
commerce practices, we must break down the processes into user flows, permissions, features, and strategies. Here's a detailed roadmap:

 
  
   
   

## Key Parameters for Artwork Approval
### Parameters for Subadmin to Check:
1. Image Quality 
    
     Resolution: Should meet platform standards (e.g., 300 DPI for printing).
    
     Clarity: No visible distortions or pixelation.
2. Dimensions 
    
     Ensure dimensions align with product guidelines.
    
     Verify aspect ratio and size (e.g., small, medium, large categories).
3. Frame Availability 
    
     Check if framing options are provided or required.
    
     Note if framing adheres to platform standards.
4. Authenticity 
    
     Identify AI 
     generated vs. real artwork:
      
       Request an originality certificate if necessary.
      
       Run AI detection tools for suspicious images.

5. Description Accuracy 
    
     Verify if the description matches the artwork.
    
     Ensure keywords (e.g., "canvas," "oil painting") and categories are accurate.
    
     Remove irrelevant or misleading details.
6. Category Validation 
    
     Confirm appropriate classification (e.g., abstract, landscape, portrait).
7. Material Information 
    
     Validate materials like "canvas," "oil paint," or "digital print."
    
     Ensure material details align with product metadata.

 
  
   
   

## User Flows
### 1. Artist Workflow 
    
     Upload artwork with title, description, category, material, dimensions, price, and framing options.
    
     Submit for review by the subadmin.

### 2. Subadmin Workflow 
    
     Login: Authenticate into the subadmin dashboard.
    
     View Uploads: Access the "Pending Approvals" section to review newly uploaded artwork.
    
     Approve or Request Edits:
      
       Approve if all parameters are satisfactory.
      
       Request changes if discrepancies exist (e.g., inaccurate description).
    
     Assign for Publishing:
      
       After approval, assign the artwork for final review by the admin.
    
     Post 
     Approval Tasks:
      
       Track sales performance of managed artists' products.
      
       Handle artist disputes and queries.
    
     Modify Description (if allowed):
      
       Fix typos, add keywords for SEO, or reclassify categories.

### 3. Admin Workflow 
    
     Oversee approvals granted by subadmins.
    
     Ensure pricing aligns with platform strategy.
    
     Manage escalations from subadmins/artists/customers.
    
     Handle refund requests and high 
     level complaints.

 
  
   
   

## Permissions
### Artist 
    
     Upload artwork.
    
     Edit description before submission.
    
     View status of submissions (approved, rejected, pending).
    
     Track sales and earnings.

### Subadmin 
    
     Review artwork and descriptions.
    
     Approve or request changes.
    
     Modify descriptions within limits (optional).
    
     Monitor performance of assigned artists.
    
     Generate reports for admin.

### Admin 
    
     Full access to all subadmin functionalities.
    
     Override subadmin approvals if needed.
    
     Handle pricing, refunds, disputes, and delivery escalations. 
     To implement **ReviewArtworks** effectively and onboard artists fully on your eCommerce platform, the following changes in the **Product Schema** and **User Schema** are recommended:

AADHAR AUTHENTICATION
host – Aadhaar authentication server address. Actual production server address will be
provided to ASAs. Note that production servers can only be accessed through private
secure connection. ASA server should ensure that actual URL is configurable. (For
development and testing purposes, public URL “auth.uidai.gov.in” can be used.)
ver – Authentication API version (mandatory). UIDAI may host multiple versions for
supporting gradual migration. For this specification, version is “2.5”.
ac – A unique code for the AUA which is assigned by UIDAI. This is an alpha-numeric
string having maximum length 10.(A default value “public” is available for testing.)
uid[0] and uid[1] – First 2 digits of Aadhaar Number. When VID, UID Token, or
encrypted Aadhaar number (future) is used, pass “0” and “0” for these.
asalk – A valid ASA license key. ASAs must send one of their valid license keys at the
end of the URL. It is important that license keys are maintained safely. When adding
license key to the URL, ensure it is “URL encoded” to handle special characters.
For all valid responses, HTTP response code 200 is used. All application error codes are
encapsulated in response XML element. In the case of connection and other server
errors, standard HTTP error response codes are used (4xx codes such as 403, 404, etc.).
HTTP automatic redirects also should be handled by ASA server.

a. Modern CSS Frameworks
CSS Grid and Flexbox: These layout modules make it easier to create complex, responsive layouts without the need for frameworks like Bootstrap. CSS Grid provides a two-dimensional layout system, while Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts.
PostCSS: A tool that allows for automatic processing of CSS, including support for modern features like nesting, autoprefixing, and future CSS syntax.
CSS Variables: These provide a way to store values for repeated use in stylesheets, improving maintainability and flexibility in themes.
b. UI Animations
Framer Motion: A popular library for animating React components. It provides a simple API for creating complex animations like fades, slides, and transitions.
GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform): A high-performance animation library for JavaScript that works across all major browsers and devices, enabling smooth animations.
Lottie: A lightweight library that allows for easy integration of animated vector graphics in JSON format, typically created using Adobe After Effects.
c. Dark Mode and Custom Themes
CSS Media Queries: Developers can use @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) to adapt a site’s theme to users' system preferences for dark or light mode, improving accessibility and user experience.
Theming with Tailwind CSS: Using its built-in dark mode support, developers can easily create applications that toggle between dark and light themes with minimal effort.
d. Web Typography
Variable Fonts: These allow for dynamic adjustments to font properties (weight, width, slant, etc.) without having to load multiple font files. This leads to faster load times and more flexibility.
Google Fonts: A large, free library of web fonts optimized for use in websites. Google Fonts provides an easy way to integrate beautiful, accessible typography.

## 
Categories and Types of Paintings
Based on the analysis of several art platforms like Artoreal, Saatchi Art, and Indian Art Zone, the common categories and types of paintings include:

Art Categories (For Paintings):

Abstract Art
Modern Art
Contemporary Art
Traditional Art
Landscape Paintings
Portrait Paintings
Figurative Art
Pop Art
Minimalist Art
Surrealism
Impressionism
Realism
Expressionism
Street Art
Digital Art (for digital artworks)
Art Types (Specific to Mediums and Materials):

Canvas Paintings
Oil Paintings
Acrylic Paintings
Watercolor Paintings
Mixed Media
Ink Paintings
Charcoal Art
Hand-Painted Art
Artoreal specifically highlights categories like Abstract Art, Contemporary Art, and Modern Art, among others, while also featuring types like Digital Art and Canvas Paintings. Saatchi Art and Indian Art Zone further include categories for styles such as Impressionism, Surrealism, and Pop Art.

Expanding to Other Arts (Like Handmade Toys, Décor)
When you expand beyond paintings to other forms of art
 like handmade toys or décor articles, the key is to
  maintain flexibility in your database schema.
   You can define a general ArtProduct schema with
    a type field that can cater to different product categories
     (paintings, toys, décor, etc.) and then separate specific 
     attributes based on the type of product. 

     Given your vision for a future-proof application with Next.js, here's a recommended approach:

---

### **1. Authentication and Authorization**
Adopt a robust, scalable, and secure authentication system:

- **Use NextAuth.js** for session management:
  - Supports multiple providers (email/password, OAuth, SSO, etc.).
  - Server-side session validation ensures security.
  - Can easily extend to role-based access control (RBAC).
  
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for APIs:
  - Use signed tokens for secure, stateless communication.
  - Store tokens in **HttpOnly cookies** for better security against XSS attacks.

---

### **2. State Management**
For global state, replace `AuthContext` with:

- **React Query** or **SWR**:
  - Ideal for fetching, caching, and synchronizing server state.
  - Automatically revalidates stale data.

- **Redux Toolkit** for complex state:
  - Use sparingly, mainly for managing non-server-specific UI states.

---

### **3. Scalability with AI Integration**
- **AI APIs and Models**:
  - Use services like OpenAI for customization and chatbots.
  - Host fine-tuned models on services like AWS SageMaker or Azure AI.

- **Serverless Functions**:
  - Use Next.js API routes to integrate AI model inference endpoints.

---

### **4. Real-Time Features**
Use WebSocket-based libraries like **Socket.IO** or **Supabase Realtime** for:

- Live delivery tracking.
- Real-time chatbots or live updates for exhibitions and webinars.

---

### **5. Content Management**
Implement a CMS tailored for art and media:

- **Sanity.io** or **Strapi**:
  - Integrates well with Next.js.
  - Offers flexibility for managing content like videos, articles, and event information.

---

### **6. Media Management**
For handling videos and images:

- **Cloudinary** or **AWS S3**:
  - Store and serve media efficiently.
  - Integrate AI for automatic tagging, resizing, and quality optimization.

---

### **7. Scalability and Future-Proofing**
- **Modular Architecture**:
  - Separate features into independent, scalable modules.
  - Decouple AI, chatbots, and content management into microservices.

- **Headless Architecture**:
  - Use a headless CMS and APIs to serve data across platforms (web, mobile, etc.).

---

### **8. Deployment and Monitoring**
- **Vercel**:
  - Optimized for Next.js with automatic scaling.
  
- **Monitoring**:
  - Use tools like Sentry for error tracking.
  - Implement observability platforms like Datadog for performance monitoring.

---

This approach ensures your application is flexible, future-proof, and ready to handle complex features and integrations. Let me know if you'd like to dive deeper into any specific aspect!
src/store/store.js: Redux store and persistor setup.
src/store/slices/authSlice.js: Auth slice for managing authentication and roles.
src/app/layout.js: Wraps the app with Redux and Persist providers.
